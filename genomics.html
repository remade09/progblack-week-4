        <h1>
            Developments in Tecnology and Computer Science has made genomic research cheaper and more accessable
        </h1>

        <h2>
            It took the short period of <b>thirteen years</b> for the first genome to be sequenced, and cost around <b>two billion pounds</b>. Now, with advanced in tecnology, a human genome can be <b>sequenced within a day and costs around £450</b>
        </h2>

        <ul class="genomicList">
            <li>Genetic diseases can be identified much more quickly</li>
            <li>Medicine can be personalised for the individual, tailored to their specific genetic fault</li>
            <li>Babies can be rapidly tested before and after birth for genetic disorders
                <ul>
                    <li>This means they can recieve immediate treatment straight after birth, improving treatment success rates</li>
                    <li>Inherited diseases can be screened for and spotted, allowing parents to make more informed decisions</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Scientists can use hundred of thousands of genome sequences for research
                <ul>
                    <li>This allows for faster research surrounding genes and their effects on the body</li>
                    <li>Faster drug and therapy development, allowing genetic diseases to be treated more effectively</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            But how has computer science helped?
        </h2>
        <ul class="genomicList">
            <li>Modern sequencing devices use high speed sensors and nanotecnology to read DNA at high speeds</li>
            <li>With advances in tecnology causing processors and lasers becoming so much smaller, sequencers can now be made as handheld, portable devices that can be taken to some of the remotest regions to sample plants and animals there.</li>
            <li>Samples are handled by increasingly accurate robots, allowing samples to be processed automatically, reducing error.</li>
            <li>Modern Processors and GPU's allow for the huge volume of data produced when sequencing to be analysed and compared in a considerably shorter timeframe.</li>
            <li>Specially built software allows scientists to detects differences or mutations quickly and effectively</li>
