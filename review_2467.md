### Interest of content
+ Except the genomics page, the content is pretty bare bones

### Consistency and quality of visual presentation
+ The repeating background is a little intense on the eyes...
+ Some text is quite difficult to read, as the white text is close in colour to the pink background

### Quality of written presentation
+ Grammar and spelling is a bit iffy - 'Secuirty is important cos u could get hacked!! People have been hacked before and lost money and data, it's like kinda bad.'
+ Genomics page is good except for continued misspelling of the word technology
+ Lack of capitalisation on banking page

### Validity of HTML
+ All appears to be working well, good job!
+ Good implementation of the repeating background
+ (The house image on the home page isn't resizing but that's fairly minor)

### Evidence of collaboration
+ Going off of commit history, contribution appears to have been very equal :)
+ Author's notes are just links to github pages - can't tell whether they were added by someone other than the author
