            Developments in computing have allowed consumers to access information about their finances directly from their mobile devices.\
            This has ushered in a new age of convenience for all consumers, reducing the amount of time it takes them to check the status of their accounts,\n 
            while also letting them do it from the comfort of their own homes.
